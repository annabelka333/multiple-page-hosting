    <h1>ðŸ§€Famous blue cheese</h1>
    <p>
      The history of blue cheese goes back to the 7th century, to a cave outside
      the village in France. Legend has it that a distracted shepherd forgot his
      lunch of bread and cheese in the cave. When he returned a few months
      later, the cheese had become infested with penicillium roqueforti, a mould
      that was growing in the cave. Today this natural mould is refined and used
      for almost all blue cheeses simply by adding the mould culture to the
      cheese milk. For the cheese to turn blue, oxygen must reach the inside of
      the cheese. This is often done by piercing the cheese with thin needles or
      skewers. The blue mould then matures inside the air tunnels, developing
      flavour as it ages. Most mould-containing cheeses take 3 to 6 months to
      mature. In blue cheese, this happens from the inside out.
